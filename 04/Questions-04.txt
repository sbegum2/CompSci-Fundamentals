Describe the biggest challenge you faced on this lab:
        The biggest challenge in this lab was using the cumulation of skills and
        commands we learned throughout the course for these programs. I didn't 
        remember indexing or the command but knew I needed a command like it
        for the purpose of olympics.py and eventually got there.
