Describe the biggest challenge you faced on this lab:

        I kept making small sytax errors with my parentheses since this lab required a lot of type conversion. Figuring out where/when to start running a loop was also somewhat difficult but it became clearer as it went along. I didn't find this lab as techinically difficult but it definitely required more thought that the other labs so far.
