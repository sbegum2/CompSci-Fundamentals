Describe the biggest challenge you faced on this lab: 
  
  I found the instructions confusing. I struggled in the beginning because I
  kept trying to make a list of 4 user inputted runes instead of just the 7
  base runes. What I was trying to do would be implemented later. When there 
  weren't sample outputs I found it tough to translate the function goals into
  do-able python instructions. I got there eventually though!
