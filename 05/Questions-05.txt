Describe the biggest challenge you faced on this lab:
        The biggest challenge I faced in this lab was differentiating between 
        all of my functions and remembering to pass variables between them. It
        was hard starting from a point where I had smaller goals working
        towards a larger goal just because I had to go back and edit them 
        afterwards. In the long-run it was definitely more helpful going
        function by function and making sure they all ran.
