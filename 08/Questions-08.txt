Describe the biggest challenge you faced on this lab:
        I found this lab to be less difficult than the previous ones because
        of out TDD. It broke down the components of the program into simpler
        steps I knew how to carry out. I did find it difficult not working 
        linearlly and instead jumping around creating end functions at the
        beginning and so on.
