Describe the biggest challenge you faced on this lab:
        The biggest challenge with this lab was interpreting the lab write-up.
        I was trying to run my searches without using the HydroDam record
        class as I didn't understand that it should be used in both the
        searches and printing. When I figured out how to use the given 
        resources, the lab made more sense.
